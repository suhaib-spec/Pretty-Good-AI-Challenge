User: To help with your request?
Agent: Oh, yeah, sorry. Um, it's March 15th, 1985.
User: Let me confirm I have your name as Jennifer Martinez, and your date of birth is March fifteenth. Nineteen eighty. Is that correct?
User: If so, could you please spell your first and last name for me?
Agent: Wait, no - you said nineteen eighty, but I said nineteen eighty-five. My birth year is 1985, not 1980.
User: Thanks for clarifying. To confirm, is your date of birth March fifteenth nineteen eighty five?
User: If that's correct, can you please spell your first and last name for me?
Agent: Yes, that's correct. Um, it's J-E-N-N-I-F-E-R, and then Martinez is M-A-R-T-I-N-E-Z.

Agent: Yes, that's correct.
User: Can't proceed further right now, but I'll make sure our clinic support team follows up with you. Let me document your request for their review. Can you tell me what you need help with today so I can include it in my note?
Agent: Oh, um, I was actually calling to schedule an appointment. I've been having some knee pain for like the past couple weeks and I wanted to see a doctor about it.
User: Got it. I've noted that you need to see a doctor for knee pain that's lasted a couple of weeks. Our clinic support team will reach out as soon as they can to help you schedule an appointment. Is there anything else you'd like me to mention in my note for them?
Agent: Um, no, I think that's it. So... they'll just call me back then?
User: Yes. That's right. The clinic support team will call you back as soon as possible to help with your appointment. If you have any other questions, just let us know.
Agent: Okay, thanks. Bye.
